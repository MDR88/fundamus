1. Update (putting the U in CRUD) - for this one, you need three terminal windows/tabs:
- navigate into the `src/` folder, run `npm i`, then run `grunt`
- navigate into the `api/` folder, run `json-server -w database.json`
- navigate into the `dist/` folder (once grunt has created it) and run `hs -o`
